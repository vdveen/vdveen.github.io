        <p>It doesn&#39;t take long to get lost in technical jargon and buzzwords when you try to find out what Ethereum really
          is. It&#39;s uncensorable. It&#39;s decentralized. It&#39;s a blockchain. It&#39;s unregulated. It&#39;s secure.
          If you string all of those together, you could say that Ethereum is "a generalised protocol for decentralized,
          secure transaction-based state-changing virtual machines."</p>

        <p>If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;re now stuck with more questions than before. What on earth is a &#39;decentralized
          virtual machine&#39;? What is a blockchain? What does it <em>look</em> like, and why is it secure? </p>

        <p>And most of all, why should I care?</p>

        <p>I decided to delve into books and papers on Ethereum to explain - in plain English - how Ethereum <em>really</em>          works. Let&#39;s start with the <em>why</em> question. Why does Ethereum matter?</p>

        <hr> </hr>
        <h3 class="ethtitle">The Big Picture</h3>

        <p>There is a lot of hype around digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is in no small part because of the
          insane price rises over the last few years. In 2010, a Bitcoin enthusiast used 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas.
          Seven years later, those pizzas are worth over <em>forty million dollars</em>. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 5%">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p>The Ethereum currency, called Ether (and shortened to ETH or &#926; ) has also risen dramatically, from under a dollar
          in early 2015 to more than $300 as of writing. So on the one hand, you have a bunch of speculators cheering this
          new technology on, hoping that it will continue to rise spectacularly. They don&#39;t need to understand how it
          works as long as the price continues to go up.</p>

        <p>But on the other hand, you have people who believe that Ethereum could just be <strong><em>the biggest innovation in economics since the invention of money</em></strong>.
        </p>

        <p>And yes, this has to do with all the buzzwords I mentioned. What makes Ethereum unlike anything before is that it
          is designed as a global, programmable computer with programmable money. </p>

        <p>This global computer consists of thousands of individual computers connected to each other. These computers work
          together as if they&#39;re one robust machine. Every computer has a copy of all the information, so if one computer
          fails it&#39;s not a big deal. </p>

      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p>Ethereum is not just a digital way to store value - you can make that digital value <em>do</em> stuff on that global
          computer. With the Ethereum Virtual Machine you can write agreements about anything of value, between anyone on
          the planet, in a transparent and secure way. </p>

        <p>You could write an app for every financial service you can think of. Banking, loaning, buying, selling, crowdfunding,
          trading, bartering, gambling, royalties, you name it. It&#39;s not just limited to people - computers can interact
          with the Ethereum Virtual Machine as well. The Ethereum Virtual Machine makes microtransactions feasible, so your
          phone could start paying services for you. In Germany, your electric car can already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/68n6lq/">pay the cost of 
          charging</a> at a charging station for you because of Ethereum.</p>


        <p>These exchanges and agreements cannot be overruled by any adversary, organization or government. Once an agreement
          is made, it can&#39;t be changed on a whim. </p>


        <p><strong><em>Ethereum can give everyone the power to exchange value, much like the Internet has given everyone the power to communicate.</em></strong>          </p>
        <p>Note the word &#39;can&#39; and &#39;could&#39;. Although Ethereum in its current state can do an awful lot already,
          development is ongoing and learning curves are remarkably steep. </p>
        <p>With that in mind, what's Ethereum made of that makes this all possible? </p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3 class="ethtitle">Information & Protocols</h3>
        <p>Because exchanging value is arguably the most important thing Ethereum does, we&#39;re gonna start there. What happens
          when you transfer money to someone? Well, your account is reduced by some amount of money, and another account
          is increased by the exact same amount of money.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>Regular banks keep a record of all transactions and use that to determine how much you have. Your balance is simply
          all money that went in minus all money that went out.</p>
        <p>Such a record of all transactions orderd chronologically is called a <em>ledger</em>. The blockchain is basically
          a digital ledger. Each block in the chain is nothing more than a few dozen transactions with some information about the block itself.

        number and who created it. It also contains technical stuff like the difficulty, hashes (more on that later) and
        the gas limit.</p>
      <p>Each block must say which block came before it - this is the <em>chain</em> part of blockchain. There is a chain of
        blocks from the first block (aptly called the &#39;genesis block&#39;) to the current block. </p>

        <p>Every computer in the network store a copy of this blockchain locally. When a new block is successfully added to
          the chain, every computer updates their version of the blockchain with peer-to-peer filesharing. <br/></p>
        <p>The above is true for both Bitcoin and Ethereum (and a bunch of other blockchains), but this is also where similarities
          end and differences begin. Ethereum stores not just transactions, but also <em>states</em>. A state is simply something
          that an object has and that can be changed. The <code>color</code> state of a traffic light might be <code>green</code>,
          but it might also be <code>red</code>. <code>color = green</code> and <code>color = red</code> are two different
          states of one object.
        </p>
        <p>Ethereum can store all kinds of states describing all kinds of real things, from monetary value and data files to
          your pet&#39;s name. If you have an Ethereum wallet, its balance is stored as a state (literally as <code>balance = ...</code>).
          This information is not stored in the blockchain, but in a separate state database. As you might expect, you use
          a transaction to reduce your balance and increase someone else&#39;s balance by the same amount. </p>
        <p>But how do you create a state for your pet&#39;s name, and how do you change it? Here&#39;s the key: Ethereum transactions
          don&#39;t just change account balances. In Ethereum, a transaction can change <em>any</em> kind of state. If you
          - for some reason - have stored <code>petname =  Mr. Fluffalopolous</code> , you use a transaction to change that
          state to <code>petname = Mr. Fluffalopolous the Third</code>. </p>

        <p>Note that you can&#39;t just change someone else&#39;s states - this isn&#39;t Wikipedia. There are rules about what
          you can and can&#39;t do with transactions. This is what people mean when they talk about the Ethereum <em>protocol.</em>          A protocol is simply a bunch of rules about what is and isn&#39;t allowed. </p>
        <p>Some things are never allowed by the protocol. You can&#39;t send more money than you have, for example. You also
          can&#39;t just create money out of thin air, or make it disappear. The Ethereum ledger balances itself because
          the protocol doesn&#39;t allow unbalanced transactions. </p>
        <p>It&#39;s not always so restrictive. The protocol leaves it up to you to decide who can and cannot change your pet&#39;s
          name. This is one of the freedoms you have when programming with Ethereum. </p>
        <p>So if someone asks you what Ethereum <em>is</em>, you can now give them a good answer. <strong>Ethereum is a global <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer'>mainframe</a> computer.</strong>          This computer runs on three main ingredients:</p>
        <ol start=''>
          <li>States, which can be changed by...</li>
          <li>Transactions, which are governed by...</li>
          <li>The Ethereum Protocol</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Having a global computer is nice and all, but how do I know it&#39;s safe? What makes Ethereum so secure?</p>

    <h3><a name='header-n95' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Part 2. Decentralized Security</h3>
    <p>Ethereum is often called a cryptocurrency. This is not just because it sounds cool - although it obviously does. The
      &#39;crypto&#39; part refers to the science of <em>cryptography</em>. Cryptography aims to define secure protocols
      to allow communication without anyone reading or tampering with it. </p>
    <p>One of the cryptographic tools that Ethereum uses a lot is called a <em>secure hashing algorithm</em>, or SHA. This algorithm
      takes any kind of data as an input and changes that data in a specific way. For example, if I hash
      <code>veenspace</code> with the SHA-1 algorithm, the output is the hash <code>e4a192365543903d6015465069f262b7d707e5b6</code>.
      (&#39;Hash&#39; is both a verb and a noun.) </p>
    <p>You can picture hashing as a cryptographic blender. Put any kind of data in, blend it for a fixed amount of time and
      the result is a blended - &#39;hashed&#39; - bunch of letters and numbers. </p>
    <p>It&#39;s not just any blender though. It blends one way only: you can&#39;t retrieve the original words from the mess
      of letters and numbers. The blender always blends the same way: when you give it a specific input, it will always produce
      the same output. If you put <code>veenspace</code> through SHA-1, which you can do <a href='http://www.sha1-online.com/'>here</a>,
      it will <em>always</em> give you the hash <code>e4a192365543903d6015465069f262b7d707e5b6</code> . </p>
    <p>Most importantly, even the smallest change to the input will create a different output. Take, for example, the entire
      <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt'>Adventures of Sherlock</a>. If you hash the entire book,
      the result is <code>85ce3d0483d114fe67ee304c0d7522a31fa4e8a6</code>. Now I changed one word in there, hashed the entire
      book agian and the result is <code>08f0ee20fcffe7028787ee5232b9ae80de016857</code>. Note how pretty much every part
      of this second hash is a completely different letter or number than the first. </p>
    <p>You might think that&#39;s the lamest party trick ever (and you wouldn&#39;t be wrong) but it&#39;s the key to Ethereum&#39;s
      security. Each block in the blockchain contains a hash of all previous states and all previous transactions. So if
      some supervillain wanted to &#39;rewrite history&#39; in the blockchain, changing just a single digit somewhere would
      be instantly noticable <em>because the hashes would be completely different</em>.<br/></p>
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    <p></p>
    <p>I said that there was no way to reverse the blender, which is not <em>entirely</em> true. You can try and guess what
      the original input was, and see if the hash you end up is the same. How many guesses? More than you think. If you were
      to make ten million guesses each second on Ethereum&#39;s hashing algorithm, it would still take - on average - 1,600
      days or about 4,5 years to find the correct answer. </p>
    <p>How hard is it? Well, imagine picking a random Canadian, and having them pick another random Canadian. Now guess which
      pair of people are the correct ones by asking all 36,000,000 Canadians about all 36,000,000 other Canadians, one by
      one. That&#39;s roughly how hard it is to guess. </p>
    <p>Despite this difficulty, the Ethereum network of computers makes a correct guess every 15 seconds. <em>This guessing game is what&#39;s called mining</em>.
      Because all computers in the network are guessing at random the winner is also random. As a reward, the computer that
      is the first to guess correctly (so, to find the original word) gets to add a new block to the blockchain. This computer
      - the &#39;miner&#39; - is also awarded 5 ETH for their hard work. </p>
    <p>Simply winning the guessing game isn&#39;t enough to add your block to the chain though. Every other computer in the
      network needs to double-check your block. Not only do they check if you haven&#39;t altered the blockchain, they also
      validate each transaction in the block and validate your guess. </p>
    <p>Validating the guess is easy: all you need to do is input the guess into the Ethereum hashing algorithm, and it should
      spit out the hash that everyone&#39;s been working on. It&#39;s hard to guess <code>veenspace</code> when all you have
      is <code>e4a192365543903d6015465069f262b7d707e5b6</code> , but the other way around can literally be done in less than
      0.1 seconds. </p>
    <p>Only when the majority of the network agrees that your guess was correct and that you changed the states correctly is
      your block valid and thus considered &#39;true&#39;. If you happen to be a supervillain who wants to ignore the protocol
      and create Ether out of thin air, you would need to have the majority of the network in your own hands. Such an attack
      - called a &#39;51% Attack&#39; - is unreasonably expensive and very easy to notice, so not profitable at all. </p>
